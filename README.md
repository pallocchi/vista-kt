> Vista is currently under heavy development ðŸ› 

Vista is a technical analysis library for Kotlin, inspired in [Pine Script][ps] from TradingView.

```kotlin
val data = dataOf("https://pallocchi.github.io/vista/amzn.csv")

val fast = data.sma(9)
val slow = data.sma(30)

when {
    fast crossOver slow -> print("I'm going long!")
    fast crossUnder slow -> print("I'm going short!")
}
```

Full documentation is available [here](https://pallocchi.github.io/vista).

## Gradle

First you need to add the Bulltimate repository:

```kts
repositories {
    maven {
        setUrl("https://dl.bintray.com/bulltimate/maven/")
    }
}
```

After that the library can be added as a usual dependency:

```kts
dependencies {
    implementation('com.bulltimate:vista:0.2.0')
}
```
